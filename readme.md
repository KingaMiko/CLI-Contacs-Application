# Node Homework

## Step 1

<ul>
<li>Initialize npm in the project</li>
<li>In the root of the project, create a file index.js</li>
<li>Install package nodemon as development dependency (devDependencies)</li>
<li>In package.json file add "scripts" to run index.js</li>
<li>start script that starts index.js with node</li>
<li>start:dev script that starts index.js with nodemon</li>
</ul>

## Step 2

Create a folder db in the root of the project. To store contacts, download and use the contacts.json file, putting it in the db folder. <br>

<ul> At the root of the project, create a contacts.js file.
<li>Make imports of modules fs and path to work with the file system</li>
<li>Create a contactsPath variable and put the path to the contacts.json file in it. To compose a path, use the methods of the path module</li>
<li>Add functions to work with a collection of contacts. In functions, use the fs module and its readFile() and writeFile() methods</li>
<li>Make export of created functions via module.exports</li>
</ul>

## Step 3

Make an import of the contacts.js module in the index.js file and check the functionality of the functions for working with contacts.

## Step 4

The index.js file imports the yargs package for convenient parsing of command line arguments. Use the ready-made function invokeAction() which receives the type of action to be performed and the required arguments. The function calls the appropriate method from the contacts.js file, passing it the necessary arguments. <br>
Alternatively, you can use the commander module to parse command line arguments. This is a more popular alternative to the yargs module.

## Step 5

Run the commands in the terminal and take a separate screenshot of the result of each command.

## Step 6 - Homework Submission

Command execution screenshots can be uploaded to any free cloud image storage service (Example: monosnap, imgbb.com) and the corresponding links are necessary add to the README.md file. Create this file at the root of the project. Then attach a link to the homework repository at LMS for mentor to check.
